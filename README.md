# Project Background
## Overview
This project is a Python-based GUI application designed to parse and visualize XML files representing users in a social network. The system encapsulates user data, including unique identifiers, names, posts, and followers. This interactive application provides a range of functionalities, from ensuring XML consistency to advanced network analysis, making it a versatile tool for managing and analyzing social network data.
## Key Features
### XML Consistency Checking and Correction
The program detects and visually presents inconsistencies in XML files. These may include missing opening or closing tags and mismatched tags. Furthermore, the application is equipped to resolve these errors, ensuring correct nesting of the XML tags.
### XML Formatting and Minification
To enhance readability and reduce file size, the application supports XML formatting by maintaining proper indentation for each level. Additionally, users can benefit from a minification feature that eliminates unnecessary whitespaces and indentations, resulting in smaller-sized XML files.
### XML to JSON Conversion
The utility extends its capabilities to converting XML files to JSON format, providing flexibility in data representation.
### Graph Data Structure Representation
Underlying the system is a graph data structure that efficiently represents the relationships between users, their posts, and followers. This structure facilitates network analysis, offering valuable insights into user influence, activity levels, mutual followers.

### Network Analysis
The application leverages the graph data structure to perform comprehensive network analysis. Users can identify the most influential and active users, explore mutual followers between two users, and receive personalized suggestions for new connections.
### Post Search
Effortlessly search for posts containing specific words or topics within the social network. This feature provides users with a quick and efficient way to extract relevant information from a vast pool of data.
### Undo/Redo Operations
The inclusion of undo and redo functionality enhances user experience by allowing seamless reverting or reapplication of changes made during the editing process. This feature adds a layer of flexibility to user interactions.
## Technical Implementation
To meet project constraints, the implementation adheres to a set of predefined data structures, including arrays, dynamic arrays (vectors), linked lists, stacks, queues, and priority queues (heap). Notably, the team had the challenge of implementing the map function from scratch.
